## Summary

Generally I thought it was a fun exercise. I would like to explore the CLI as well as gain a better understanding of logging and troubleshooting.

I did like what appears to be a new feature, when creating a new CI/CD use case, it creates and managing all the other necessary resources. 


### My Approach

1. Review **Getting Started** documentation and Overview of the platform to get an understanding of how things work
2. I forked a simple Flask application
3. Added and update the Dockerfile to build the image
4. I then got a basic GH Action Workflow running on commit
5. I added some simple tests that I could easily force to fail.
6. I then integrated GitHub with the Kubiya platform. 

### Challenges
1. Some how I found multiple version of the documentation, probably googling rather then navigating the Kubiya.ai documentation site. This caused me some issues. It's likely that there are still some publicly accessible documentation out there that should be rooted out and killed off. :)
2. My development laptop went by-by with my recent layoff, I had to recreate my dev environment from scratch before starting, installing all the DevOps tooling that was needed.
3. I had to resist the urge to get too fancy with the tests and documents, as I was on a tight schedule.
4. I had some challenges initially with the use case and getting the correct configuration on the GH access token.
